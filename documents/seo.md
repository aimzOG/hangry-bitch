#SEO & Analytics

##**What Was Learned?**

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. If a site is well optimized, the quantity of site traffic increases. The site will appear at the top of search results and expose the brand organically. Predictive SEO is one way to increase SEO as it predicts trends amongst the crowds. This allows the site to be ahead of the competition so that when the prime time comes, the site is at the top of searches. Most internet users will click on the top 5 links. The search engine looks through the site content to pick out the content relative to the search. It is important that sites organize their content appropriately not just for SEO but for user usability. Something to avoid when working on SEO is decieving users and search engine. It leads to distrust and can potentially penalize site owners. Avoid hidden links, improperly named content and such. 

Analytics of site usage (such as KPI- key Performance Index) is important because it can show what part of the site is clicked on most, where the traffic is coming from, demographics of users (depending) and much much more. This allows the developer to modify their sites to be more optimal for their users.
